"""Guards for /reset's two scopes: documents and profile.

Both scopes have the same failure mode - /reset promises a clean slate it
does not deliver, because something that writes personal data is missing
from the Step 1 preview the user confirms and from the Step 3 execution.

Documents scope: /reset ends its documents pass by telling the user "The
`documents/` folder is now empty." That statement is only true if every
personal-data drop folder is actually covered by both the Step 1 preview
and the Step 3 delete block. `documents/postings/` was missing from both
while being documented in documents/README.md and protected as personal
data by tools/security_guards.py (review finding F26, 2026-08-19), so a
reset silently kept the user's hand-pasted job postings.

Profile scope: the same class of gap, one scope over. /setup Step 3
populates six skill files, and /reset profile cleared four of them -
`04-job-evaluation.md` (the user's match areas, career goals, financial
situation and schedule constraints) was listed by name as containing
"framework rules, not candidate data", and `job-scraper/search-queries.md`
(their role titles, city and commute tiers) appeared nowhere in reset.md.
Both are tracked and unignored, and CI's placeholder-integrity job guards
04-job-evaluation.md under "personal data may have been committed", so a
"blank" profile left /rank scoring against the old skills and /scrape
running the old city.

Both file lists are derived - the documents folders from the repository
tree, the profile files from /setup Step 3's own headings - so a new drop
folder or a new /setup target fails this test until /reset covers it.
