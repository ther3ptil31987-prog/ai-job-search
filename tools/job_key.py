"""Canonical dedup key for a job posting, and an audit for existing state.

`/scrape` Step 4 keys every seen_jobs.json entry by company+title. The rule was
prose only ("<url_or_company_title_key>"), so each run slugified in its own way
and the state file accumulated two distinct failures:

  * Keys carrying characters that break things downstream. `/apply` and
    `/outcome` derive an archive folder name from the same company+role pair,
    and documents/README.md's subfolder rule exists because a "/" splits that
    path across directories. Real examples found in a live workspace:
    "deloitte_junior-cybersecurity-analyst-(ot/iot)",
    "neverhack-estonia_penetration-tester-/-red-teamer",
    "ops-consulting,-llc_malware-analyst".

  * The same job stored twice under different keys, because one run truncated
    the title at a different point than the next. "deloitte_cyber-intelligence-
    center-security-analy" and "deloitte_cyber-intelligence-center-security-
    analyst-at" are one posting, one URL, two entries - and dedup is the whole
    point of the file.

Both are fixed by making the key a pure, deterministic function of the posting.
Truncation is length-capped *and* disambiguated by a hash of the full slug, so a
long title always produces the same key and two different long titles never
collide.

A title that slugifies to nothing (a posting written in a non-Latin script) has
no usable key half at all - "securion_" was a real entry, and it would have
collided with every future non-Latin posting from that company. Those fall back
to the portal's numeric id from the URL. A title or company that slugifies to
*less* than it says is the same problem one step on: "Программист 1С" and
"Аналитик 1С" both fold to "1", "Сбер AI" and "Яндекс AI" both fold to "ai",
so whenever the ASCII fold drops letters the surviving fragment is only a
readable prefix and the identity comes from the same fallback.

Usage:
  python3 tools/job_key.py --company "Acme Corp" --title "SOC Analyst (L2)"
  python3 tools/job_key.py --audit job_scraper/seen_jobs.json

Exit 0 when a key is produced, or when an audit finds nothing. Exit 1 when an
audit finds violations.
